DEgenerator‚Ñ¢ - static website generator. But there is a nuance.
The idea for the project was born immediately after working with other generators: I wanted to make yet another generator, but my own. With its own atmosphere, so to speak.
Several things added fuel to the fire of enthusiasm: it was mid-January, and the project was still not planned.
I had to pull myself together and finally do something. Under this ‚Äúdo something‚Äù it was easiest to perceive near-IT procrastination: it is always easier to read habr.com on a topic of interest than, in fact, the code.
Having learned about the release of Go with the http module updated for the better, I realized that the time had come.

In essence, DEgenerator (all matches with Deutschland are occasional) is a regular static site generator.
In addition, it can assemble an MD file from existing HTML code.

The project is in semi-active development: if there is a minute free from studying, not occupied by another time killer, the project spews out a sheaf of sparks, and life begins to glimmer in it again. That's how we live.
